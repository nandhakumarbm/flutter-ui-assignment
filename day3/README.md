## 📘 What I Learned Today

### 1. SizedBox Usage and UI Component Structuring

Today I explored how `SizedBox` works along with its commonly used attributes.  
I also learned how to break down large UI components into smaller, reusable widgets.  
This approach makes the codebase cleaner, easier to understand, and reusable across multiple places in the app.
