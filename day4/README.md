## What I Learned Today

### BuildContext and Its Role

I explored what `BuildContext` is in Flutter, why every widget’s `build` method receives it.

### Underscore Prefix in Class or Widget Names

I learned why we prefix a class or widget name with `_` in Flutter and Dart.

### Routing Concepts

I went through Flutter’s routing flow, including how navigation works, when to use `Navigator.push`, `Navigator.pop`, named routes.

## What I Completed Today

### UI Enhancements

I performed UI refinements, especially adjusting font sizes to match the reference design more accurately. This helped improve visual alignment.
