## 📘 What I Learned Today

### 1. StatelessWidget vs StatefulWidget

**StatelessWidget**

- Does not store any dynamic data.
- UI does not change during runtime.
- Used when content is static.

**StatefulWidget**

- Can store and update data using `setState()`.
- UI updates when internal state changes.
- Ideal for interactive components.

### 2. Importance of Folder Structure

- Helps maintain clean, scalable, and readable code.
- Separating colors, widgets, and screens makes the project easy to manage.

### 3. Basic Layout: Row

- Learned how `Row` aligns widgets horizontally.
- Explored properties like `mainAxisAlignment` and `crossAxisAlignment`.

## 📝 Summary

Day 1 focused on understanding the fundamentals required to build a clean UI:

- Created proper folder structure
- Separated color constants
- Understood Stateless and Stateful widgets
- Practiced using `Row` for layout

More UI components will be added in the upcoming days.
