## 📘 What I Learned Today

### 1. Row

I learned how the `Row` widget arranges widgets horizontally. I experimented with different alignment options to control spacing and positioning inside the row.

### 2. Column

I explored the `Column` widget, which places widgets vertically. Understanding how `mainAxisAlignment` and `crossAxisAlignment` work helped me structure layouts more clearly.

### 3. Center

I used the `Center` widget to position elements neatly in the middle of the screen. It makes alignment simple without needing extra padding or layout tricks.
